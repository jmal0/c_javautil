# c_javautil

It's probably like a rite of passage or something for a c programmer to write data structures to make it so they don't have to write c code. This is my poor attempt at doing that with the added gimmick that I'm copying the api for the data types in java.util

## Types implemented so far
* ArrayList: a dynamic array
* LinkedList: a singly-linked list
